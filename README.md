## General info
The purpose of this project is to make the data transmitted by an OBC (on board computer) or a CanSat understandable at first sight through a text string on a serial port.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* numpy==1.18.2
* PyQt5==5.14.2
* PyQt5-sip==12.7.2
* pyqtgraph==0.10.0
* pyserial==3.4

___
## Setup
To run it you have to open the terminal in the folder and type:
```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 interface.py
```
if you don't have the electronics you can still use it! When the terminal asks you to write a serial port, write anything and it will work, obviously it won't trace any data.

## How does it work?
### How does it sample?
Every 500 ms takes a sample, this number comes from the data rate that the Arduino has. The loop is:
```
timer = pg.QtCore.QTimer()
timer.timeout.connect(update)
timer.start(500)
```

### What values uses?
The `update()` function updates the graphics and text of the interface. The first thing it does is get a list of the information to be updated.


### How does it store the information?
Clicking on the **Begin Data Logging** button calls a function of the **db** class that changes a state that determines whether the `save` method writes the information in the list.
