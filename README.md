## Support
If you used this project or learned something please give this project a star to keep doing open source projects
___

## General info
The purpose of this project is to make the data transmitted by an OBC (on board computer) or a CanSat understandable at first sight through a text string on a serial port.

The code is in spanish but the logic behind is universal.

This project is strongly related to
another [rocket science and CanSat](https://github.com/el-NASA/POA) project. **It's still in development.**

### Bugs
* Most of the times the text items disappear, i invite you to solve this :v.

* Sometimes it can't convert the first value of the list to int, but it solves it self by re-running it.
___
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* numpy==1.18.2
* PyQt5==5.14.2
* PyQt5-sip==12.7.2
* pyqtgraph==0.10.0
* pyserial==3.4

___
## Setup
To be able to run it you have to open the terminal in the folder and type:
```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requeriments.txt
$ python3 interfaz.py
```
if you don't have the electronics you can still use it! When the terminal asks you to write a serial port, write anything and it will work, obviously it won't trace any data. (but the text bug remains ;v).

## How does it work?
### How does it sample?
Every 500 ms takes a sample, this number comes from the data rate that the Arduino has. The loop is:
```
timer = pg.QtCore.QTimer()
timer.timeout.connect(update)
timer.start(500)
```

### What values uses?
The `update()` function updates the graphics and text of the interface. The first thing it does is get a list of the information to be updated, this list is noted as a `valor`.

Then within `update` you execute the *update* methods specific to each element that depends on this list.

The values it receives are:
0. Logging time
1. Relative height
2. Is in free fall (0 or 1)
3. Temperature
4. Atmospheric pressure
5. Pitch
6. Roll
7. Yaw
8. Acceleration in X
9. Y-axis acceleration
10. Z-acceleration


### How does it store the information?
Clicking on the **iniciar almacenamiento** button calls a function of the **db** class that changes a state that determines whether the `guardar` method writes the information in the list. The same happens with the **detener almacenamiento** button.

In this file the list called `valor` is stored in the same order adding at the end the date that is registered in the computer.
